# P_300_Movie-Recommendation-System
Movie Recommendation System: Scraped IMDb for top 10,000 movies, analyzed and built a content-based filtering model using directors, stars, genre, and description features. Deployed with Streamlit.

Note: Due to large size of file movie_recommendation_model.pkl, i didn't load that file, so when you try to run the deployment file depl3.py, first try to save movie_recommendation_model.pkl in your system from the notebook Movie_Recommendation_System_IMDB.ipynb
